## TODO Overview
Choose what you want to do here

### Bugs
- Blitzscreen currently does not display Qu tile as intended in an actual classic game(was not implemented yet), it displays it as Q instead
- Looking up a deactivated widget is unsafe ( cause and effects of bug unknown, almost definitely something to do with timer running when screen has been popped. )
- sometimes blitzscreen navigate gets called twice(?) successively, second call results in an empty analysis screen.
- 

### TODO now

- Settings base screen <- cy is working on this
