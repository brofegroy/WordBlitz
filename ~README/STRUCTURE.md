# Structure
The project follows the Flutter framework conventions and has a specific structure to organize the code and resources effectively.
The project's source code is located in the **/lib** folder. It contains the main Dart files that comprise the application logic.

## pubspec.yaml
This file is crucial for Flutter projects.
It defines the project dependencies, assets (such as images or fonts), and other configuration details.

## /resources
This folder contains various resources used in the application, such as images, text files, or other assets.
Note that when adding new images or assets to the /resources folder, it is important to declare them in **pubspec.yaml**.

## /lib/main.dart
This is the entry point of the application. It initializes the app and includes the main method.

## /lib/screens
The /lib/screens folder contains the screens of the application. Each screen has its own folder with three main files.

### Naming Screens
For a screen named "QuorumKazakh", the files and folder structure would look like this:

- /lib/screens/QuorumKazakh/quorum_kazakh_screen.dart
- /lib/screens/QuorumKazakh/quorum_kazakh_controller.dart
- /lib/screens/QuorumKazakh/quorum_kazakh_model.dart
- /lib/screens/QuorumKazakh/quorum_kazakh_utils/ (if required)

## /lib/tools
The /lib/tools folder contains files that provide shared logic, utilities, or configurations used across multiple screens.
These files often contain static functions or classes. Examples include config.dart, global.dart, and score_counter.dart.
The exact structure within the /lib/tools folder can be determined based on the project's needs.

## Other Folders
Folders such as /ios, /macos, /android, /windows, and /idea are generated by the Flutter framework and are specific to platform-specific code and project configuration.
Typically, you won't need to directly interact with these folders unless you have specific platform-related modifications to make.
