# TODO title
Welcome to the TODO file! This file serves as a guide to track the progress of the project and assign tasks to collaborators.
Here is where you can get started and contribute to the project.

## How to declare files
1. Put your github username/ IRL alias(that other contributors know) next to the folder you want to edit.
2. Demarcate it with a "<- github_username is working on this". this will let other know you are still working on the folder.
3. If you feel that a certain folder really should not be edited in the meantime while you edit it, you may demarcate it with a "\*<-\*", this will emphasise to others that it should not be edited in the meantime.
4. Also remember to mark what you are doing inside the **TODO Overview** section below

This is just a way to keep track of who is working on what so that there is less merge conflicts overall.
**You may still edit unmarked files if you need to.**
